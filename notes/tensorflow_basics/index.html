&ensp;Tensorflow Basics
 </div>

 <div id="p">
  Why Tensorflow? It is Google's own machine learning library and a very popular one. Tensorflow is useful either for building simple and intuitive models or for deploying massive applications that can be distributed among many different devices, like dedicated servers or even mobile devices.
<br><br>
As the title of these notes suggest, the main concepts and utilities of this library are going to be explored.
 </div>

 <div id="st">
&ensp;It is all about computational graphs
 </div>

 <div id="p">
 The hay Tensorflow works is based on computing things through graphs. What does this mean exactly? A graph, perhaps, might be the best way to make this idea clear.
 </div>

 <div id="p">
A graph, in the mathematical sense, is a set of elements that may or may not keep some sort of relationship. It is like a network where the elements are represented by nodes and the relationship between them are represented by vertices. In Tensorflow, nodes are mathematical operations and vertices signal the direction the data flows towards.
<br><br>
In the example from above information flows from left to right. The outer left nodes represent placeholders for data that will undergo certain mathematical operations; nodes <b>A</b>, <b>B</b> and <b>C</b> hold a constant value of <b>3</b>, <b>2</b> and <b>1</b> respectively. Node <b>D</b> performs a sum operation and depends on the values of <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> to compute a quantity of <b>5</b>. Similarly, <b>E</b> has dependence on <b>B</b> and <b>C</b> to compute a value of <b>1</b> through substraction.
<br><br>
Finally, as this graph's ultimate goal, node <b>F</b> computes a value of <b>1</b> through a multiplication operation that has direct dependency on nodes <b>D</b> and <b>E</b>. However, this last node indirectly depends on the values or operations that exist before its immediate neighbour nodes (<b>A</b>, <b>B</b> and <b>C</b>).
 </div>

 <div id="st">
But, why computational graphs?
 </div>

 <div id="p">
Computational graphs behave like an assembly process. Given that dependencies among nodes can be tracked, the computation process can be decomposed into several subprocesses for which computational resources can be allocated according to different needs. This is what allows a graph-based computation system to be distributed among different machines.
<br><br>
Furthermore, graphs are extremely flexible when it comes to building quantitative models from linear regression to the most sophisticated neural
networks architechtures. So, the reason why computational graphs are interesing, not to mention useful, is that both scalability and flexibility can build any kind of application no matter how simple or complex; hence, Tensorflow is worth exploring in depth.

A bit of code to exemplify
 </div>

 <div id='p' style='margin-bottom:10px;'>
There is a Tensorflow API in Python which is great for data science projects.
